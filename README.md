# How to use the application 
The best way to try the prototype out would be via the following link: [https://mzrewards-client.herokuapp.com/blockchainReward/partnerHonig]
If a valid E-mail address is provided, an E-Mail with a reward is sent to said address. If no reward is sent out, no reward was provided beforehand. So, there must be a provided reward such that the prototype works. However, a permanent reward was uploaded such that the application can be tried out.
By using the Software Developer tool in Google Chrome, the hash of the minted NFT can be seen after the E-Mail address was submitted. That way it can also be tracked on Etherscan (Rinkeby Test Net) which ensures that the prototype works and really mints the NFT. But, depending on how many times the application is used, there could be a lack of funds to mint the NFT. However, an appropriate message would be shown in the software developer tool. Additional links and information in the following.

The Backend for the prototype can be found in the following repo: [https://github.com/mzehnde/Bachelors-Thesis-server]
The Address of the smart contract used to mint the NFT: 









# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
